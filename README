# ZTF Stream Consumer

This project demonstrates how to consume astronomical alert streams from the Lasair broker using Python.

## Project Structure

- `sample_code.py`: Example code to connect to the Lasair Kafka server, consume messages, and print them in JSON format.
- `file.py`: Placeholder file (not used in the main workflow).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python packages (currently only `lasair`).
- `README`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `lasair` Python package (see `requirements.txt`).

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the sample consumer script:
```sh
python sample_code.py
```

The script will connect to the Lasair Kafka server, consume up to 10 messages from the `lasair_1568BrightFastTransients` topic, and print each message in formatted JSON.

## Notes

- You may need access credentials or network permissions to connect to the Lasair Kafka server.
